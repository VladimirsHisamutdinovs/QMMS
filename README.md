# QMMS
Potential employer task

Task:
We would like you to write a program that processes a text file stored on disk, decomposes it into
individual words and then sorts the words alphabetically. The code should be written in C++ or Java.

Guidelines:
As a guideline, the decomposition and sorting should be code you write yourself, not library code. The
code should demonstrate what you consider production ready code, you may wish to consider class
structure, formatting, comments and unit tests.

We’ll check the accuracy of the output and assess the program for style and readability. If your program
meets the required standard we’ll invite you to the next interview.
